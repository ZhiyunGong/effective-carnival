Hello world -

So many thoughts floating in my mind

The self is such a simple but yet complex concept

Can't be closer physically sometimes

Can't be farther away or more detached in some ways

It's a daily exercise to be honest with her

To listen

To accept

To just be

To forgive

So she doesn't get lost and scared again
