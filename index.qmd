Welcome! I'm a **computational biologist** working on applied Machine Learning on omics data to better assist personalized medicine. I'm also passionate about building user-friendly interactive tools to make my ML models, non-trivial data analysis more accessible to a wider audience.\

## Highlights

-   **SSc Subtyping** — ML models integrating skin & blood RNA‑seq
-   **Bayesian Optimization Toolkit** — R package + Shiny UI
-   **Spatial/single‑cell interests** — atlases, generative models, target discovery

➡️ Check out the [**Projects**](projects/index.qmd) page for live demos, or read the [**About**](about.qmd) page for my background.
