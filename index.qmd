Welcome! I'm a **computational biologist** working on ML for transcriptomics and clinical translation.  
Here you'll find papers, datasets, and interactive apps.

## Highlights

- **SSc Subtyping** — ML models integrating skin & blood RNA‑seq
- **Bayesian Optimization Toolkit** — R package + Shiny UI
- **Spatial/single‑cell interests** — atlases, generative models, target discovery

➡️ Check out the **[Apps](apps.qmd)** page for live demos, or read the **[About](about.qmd)** page for my background.
